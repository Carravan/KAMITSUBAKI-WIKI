*Translation by Vaynonym*

At that moment, my phone rang. Who knows how long it's been in my pocket since it last saw any use. It's from the Restoration Department.
"Dear Kaf, we assume that you must be feeling a sense of solitude? In that case, we bring a fortunate announcement."
They responded like they could hear my muttering. That's just how they are. No matter where I am, it seems they can always hear me. I answered them, trying not to let my embarrassment show. 
"You may rejoice! A new witch has come to the city.
It was almost breathtaking, hearing that. "Really!? Did you summon them from the real world?!"
"Yes. They possess the same power you do. The power to reach the people from the real world and stir their hearts with their singing."
According to the Restoration Department, those that possess that power are called witches. 
The power to pour your own feelings into a song and share them with others. A song imbued with feelings like that can cross the boundary between worlds and reach into the real world.
I thought that was my own special magic. It never occurred to me that there might be others.
"So I finally don't have to sing alone anymore!"
With that thought filling my mind, I couldn't help but smile to myself. It's only starting to dawn on me now, but I must've been much more lonely than I thought.
