		<p>I didn't think something like that could really happen. <br>
        Not in the real world. <br>
        Still at a loss, the Restoration Department explained to me what was going on.</p>
    <p>Kamitsubaki city is a, well, city that exists inside the virtual world. <br>
      Its existence is sustained by the power of imagination of the people living in the real world. <br>
      But that mechanism also comes at a cost, and right now this city is on the verge of destruction...</p>
    <p>The reason being that this connection doesn't just deliver the laudable parts. <br>
      Our malice flows into this world just as much. <br>
      And in the process, gradually eats away at its fabric.</p>
    <p>This is the origin of the  "Q" phenomenonâ€”<br>
      by solving the countless "Q"s plaguing Kamitsubaki city, this malice is gradually purified and the city can be restored.</p>
    <p>For that purpose, the Restoration Department gathers people from the real world willing to help in the restoration. <br>
      I was the first.</p>
    <p>"Dear Kaf,<br>
      You possess a power that no one else possesses. <br>
      The mysterious power inside your songs seeps even into the real world.<br>
      We request to harness your singing in order to rally everyone to come here - those who, by solving the Qs, will revive this city."</p>
    <p>I still didn't quite know what was what, but receiving a request like that, I decided to take on that role anyway.<br>
      I don't have any parents. I have no one who'd even notice my absence in the real world.</p>
    <p>So then why wouldn't I go here instead? If I can save this city by singing, then I'll gladly sing for it!</p>
