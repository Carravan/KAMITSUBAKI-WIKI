Translation by Saeka

As if someone was calling out to me,
I opened my eyes.

What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.
Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.

During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.
I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,
It felt like I was losing something important......

With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.
The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.

A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.
Though the buildings were sooty,
and some collapsed here and there.
The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,
and an enormous blue bird was flying around.

A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world
------ “Kamitsubaki City”
That’s where I currently reside.
