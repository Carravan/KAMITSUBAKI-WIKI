        With another friend added to our group, our days became even more exciting. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The pretty, precious, dependent Rime. The bright and vibrant and cool Haru. <br>
        The cute and delicate Sekai that makes you feel like you have a little sister. <br>
        Koko - composed and perhaps a little distant a first glance, but incredibly kind at heart.<br>
        I had so, so much fun getting to spend my time in this city with such wonderful people.<br>
        I learned that each of them seemed to have their reasons for coming to this place. <br>
        Like me, being without parents, or having trouble at home... reason to take the first chance you get away from the real world.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The one constant that connected all of us really singing. Every day we met in music room of the school in the zeroth district. <br>
        Then, we focused our singing into the real world.<br>
        Sekai's singing had a way of making you feel it in your chest, a momentous whisper. <br>
        But beyond that, her music was like a panorama of the world, like a painting with all colors.<br>
        Koko singing was translucent; beautiful in its honesty. <br>
        Sadness and happiness both had their place in her songs, <br>
        her voice wrapping around you gently, healing, encouraging.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of them were so impressive singers that you couldn't help but get fired up and try to keep up.<br>
        This of course had not just an effect on us. More and more people came to the city. <br>
        And gradually, more and more of the myriad of Qs were getting solved. I felt like things were going quite well. <br>
