</div><p>I stopped dead in my tracks.<br>
Something like a gigantic shadow of a fish was floating there on the surface of the buildings in front me. It jumped from building to building, like it was swimming through them.<br>
(Tesseract*... seems to reside in the first district as well....)<br>
I had barely gotten here when the Restoration Department taught me about it. That shadow that takes the form of a fish is called "Tesseract."<br>
Tesseract is a monster born from the desire of men. It's linked to the myriad of Qs. Left alone, it would amass more and more power, until eventually the corruption could extend all the way into the real world.<br>
It doesn't seem like it holds that level of power yet, but it's an ominous presence all the time. For now, it just seems to travel around on the surface of the buildings. And like that, it swam off again.<br>
Back alone, I took a deep breath. With my investigation reaching a dead end, and confronted with Tesseract, I became keenly aware of my own helplessness. The sun set, and night began to cover the city.<br>
"...No matter how I look at it, it looks like I'm way out of my depth here. Maybe I'll keep searching tomorrow..."<br>
The moment I finished muttering to myself—<br>
I faintly heard the voice of a young girl singing.</p><div>

        As if someone was calling out to me,<br>
        I opened my eyes.<br>

        What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.<br>
        Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.<br>
        <br>
        During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.<br>
        I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,<br>
        It felt like I was losing something important......<br>
        <br>
        With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.<br>
        The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.<br>
        <br>
        A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.<br>
        Though the buildings were sooty,<br>
        and some collapsed here and there.<br>
        The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,<br>
        and an enormous blue bird was flying around.<br>
        <br>
        A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world<br>
        ------ “Kamitsubaki City”<br>
        That’s where I currently reside.<br>
