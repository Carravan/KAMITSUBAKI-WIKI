      <p>We stepped into the building that looked similar to a church. From the inside, though, it looked quite different from an ordinary church. There was no cross, no stained glass, and instead the walls and alcoves were lined with drawings of puzzling pattern. Deeper into the building, something like a shrine had been built with two statues on lavish display, likely for worship. One statue was clad in a white robe, the other in a black one. But truly strange was that neither of them possessed a face.
        "What's with these statues..."
        I muttered to no one in particular, but Sekai answered. "There is no God in the real world with this shape. I think it's safe to assume these are the gods of this world."
        "The gods of this world?"
        "If there were people here before we were summoned, then there was probably a faith. To some gods, presumably. And quite likely, there'd be some form of shrines to them intended for worship, wouldn't there? Like this one."
        She was right. The two statues seemed to have an air about them very unlike anything from our world. Were they worshipped for our of fear or for their grace, though?
