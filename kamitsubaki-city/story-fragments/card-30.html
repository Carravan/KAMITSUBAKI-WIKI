      <p>The boy seemed to be around 10 years old. Pretty cute, too.<br>
        I wonder if he came here from the real world, too. Now that I think about it, I feel like I've seen him somewhere before. </p>
       <p>"Do you know something these memory eggs?"<br>
        "Well, I'd be lying if I said I really understood them. But they are remnants of the people that used to go here. Crystallized memories."<br>
        "Crystalized memories, huh..."<br>
         "There are a bunch of them in this city. Wanna take a look?"</p>
        <p>With the last word, the boy was already running off somewhere. Now on our own, we looked at each other.<br>
        "I don't fully get it, but the boy seemed to speak the truth, I suppose. And it certainly felt like someone's memories were replayed in my mind.<br>
        Koko nodded.<br>
        "And according to him, there are many more of them. I think if we collected them, we might eventually figure out this city's history, right?"<br>
        Sekai whispered "good idea" in adorable English, and Haru tried to contain her laughter as she responded.<br>
        "Sounds like we found ourselves a real lead here. Then let's get going, gather some memory eggs, and investigate the city's past!"<br>
        All of us cheered in response. We were all fired up.</p>
