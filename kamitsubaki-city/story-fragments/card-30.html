      <p>The boy seemed to be around 10 years old. Pretty cute, too.
        I wonder if he came here from the real world, too. Now that I think about it, I feel like I've seen him somewhere before. 
        "Do you know something these memory eggs?"
        "Well, I'd be lying if I said I really understood them. But they are remnants of the people that used to go here. Crystallized memories."
        "Crystalized memories, huh..."
        "There are a bunch of them in this city. Wanna take a look?"
        With the last word, the boy was already running off somewhere. Now on our own, we looked at each other.
        "I don't fully get it, but the boy seemed to speak the truth, I suppose. And it certainly felt like someone's memories were replayed in my mind.
        Koko nodded. "And it according to him, there are many more of them. I think if we collected them, we might eventually figure out this city's history, right?"
        Sekai whispered "good idea" in adorable English, and Haru tried to contain her laughter as she responded. "Sounds like we found ourselves a real lead here. Then let's get going, gather some memory eggs, and investigate the city's past!"
        All of us cheered in response. We were all fired up.</p>
