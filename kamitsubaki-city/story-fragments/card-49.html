      <p>Hearing Sekai's words, I I felt my own determination rise. Just like them, I wanna resist all the way to the end, without giving up. I came to this off my own accord. There's no way I'm just going to sit here and accept that the city is going to be destroyed and that I will share its fate. But what can I do, faced with the apocalypse...
        The number of Tesseracts kept increasing as they continued to devour the city. Everyone in this city was heading for the same fate. An overwhelming despair was enveloping the city.
        At that moment, a thought flashed through my mind. Back when I was first summoned to this city, the Restoration Department said something...
        "You hold a power that no one else does. A power that extends even into the real world, the mysterious power of your singing."
        The power bestowed upon us. Our "magic."
        "Let's sing, everyone. Faced with end of this world, let's turn to the people from the real world."
        To let those that come after us know what has happened in this city. And to change the end fate has foreseen. This is what we can do. Our sole remaining hope.</p>
