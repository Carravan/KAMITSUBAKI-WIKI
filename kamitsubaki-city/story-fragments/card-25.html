        Sekai, the fourth witch. She had a mysterious air about her, emanating from her. <br>
        Rime talked with as nonchalantly as anyone.<br>
        "You said something about divination, right? That you knew we'd be coming in advance?"<br>
        "Yes, it's my specialty... Incidentally, I also draw, and of course I like singing."<br>
        Sekai answered like a whisper in the wind. Seems like she's not just delicate and cute, but quite talented too.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, it seems like the whole crew's come together, then. Glad to have you with us, Sekai!"<br>
        "Hold on. We're not complete yet."<br>
        "Wait, you're saying we aren't? But the Restoration Department only mentioned 4 people. That should be all."<br>
        "Well, you see... according to my divination, there should be one more. The fifth person should arrive in this city soon."<br>
        The moment Sekai finished, some form of light started shining from within the Western-styled building.<br>
