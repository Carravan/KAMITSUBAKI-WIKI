        As we were walking out of the department store, Koko raised her voice in surprise. <br>
        "Wait, everyone! What in the world is that thing flying in the sky?"<br>
				We looked up at the sky and laid eyes on a strange creature about two meters in size. <br>
        I began to explain. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't really know that much about it either, but it seems to be some kind of bird. You see them fly in the skies above the city a lot, actually."<br>
				"Th-that so? It's rather odd for a bird... there's nothing like it in the real world."<br>
        Her words were surprising. In the beginning, it was all surprising for me too... <br>
        But strange thing after strange thing kept occurring, and eventually it all just seemed... normal.<br>
        It's so very human, isn't it, to adapt to whatever circumstances you find yourself in. It was a little frightening, really. <br>
        When did my sense of reality get so dull?<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "I guess this makes one more mystery to this city. What's with those birds, that is."<br>
        The moment I finished uttering that phrase, a strange phenomenon seemed to occur in the sky around the birds. <br>
