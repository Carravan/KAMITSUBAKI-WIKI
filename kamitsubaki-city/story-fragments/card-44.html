      <p>"...this city will be destroyed and every inhabitant annihilated."
        We were speechless, hearing it say those words like a fact. It took some time before I finally managed to force my mouth open. "Why, why is this happening.....!? We've rallied so many people to our cause, solved Q after Q after Q. And for all our effort, it was just.. not enough?!"
        "It is most unfortunate. This time, it's... But at the very least, I will be able to protect you from further harm." The Restoration Department forced its tattered body upright, and fixed its gaze upon us as it trembled. At the same time, five pillars of light appeared and gently enveloped us.
        "I will transfer all of you back to the real world. It has been my grave mistake that I summoned you here and failed to give adequate explanation in time. For this, I shall now take responsibility."
        "You'll transfer us to the real word!? But then what's going to happen to this city?!"
        "Please, do not be concerned about myself. I will also transfer the other people back to their own world shortly."
        As it spoke, an enormous shape, fish-like and about five meters in size, appeared behind it. 
        "Tesseract!" My reflexes only extended as far as shouting. The shape began to materialize and opened its maw, now lined with teeth. The Restoration Department turned around just in time to find fangs sunken deep into its body.</p>
