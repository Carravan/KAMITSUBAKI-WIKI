      <p>How long has it been since I came here, to Kamitsubaki City? I've lost any sense of time by now. It feels like an eternity passed; it feels like just yesterday. But the day itself, I remember vividly. How could I not? The day when some entity calling themselves the Restoration Department summoned me here from the real world.
        Ever since, I've been singing here day after day after day, singing to rally others from the real world to participate in the city's reconstruction. Solve the mystery of this city's existence, and thus save both worlds.
        Such was the duty given to me. The role of a witch. 
        I had always considered singing my whole being, so of course I gladly accepted the duty. I was so damn proud too, thinking my singing could be the key to saving the world. 
        …but of course I couldn't see that duty through. There is precious little time remaining. The time of collapse has creeped this close already.
        But that's exactly why, in what time I have left, I wish to leave behind these memoirs. 
        For those summoned after myself.
        For you, dear reader.</p>
