*Translation by Vaynonym*

I might be able to make a friend to sing with. The thought made me practically lean forward in curiosity and excitement.
"So, what are they like? The new witches."
"They're from the same period of time as you are. And they all love singing. I will send you their current whereabouts."
I immediately received the location of three of the girls. Well, at least that's what I figured. The actual text was garbled beyond recognition.
"Hey Restoration Department? What's with this garbled text?"
"We are so■■y, it appears that the ■■■■ of the transmission is fa■■ty. We will ■■ ■■ touch."
The connection with the Restoration Department was cut off at the end.
"Oh come on, not again..."
Looks like the Internet connection sucks as usual.
The infrastructure of the city tends to break down with the rest of it. It's hard to find good reception. But now, of all times?
(How long until I have a signal again, I wonder...)
I can't just sit here and wait. I've wanted this ever since I came to the city.
The text might be all garbled up, but there are still some clues about their whereabouts in there. With that, I can start looking for them.
"The first location seems to be Kamitsubaki City's first district. Guess I'll start off there."
With the whisper parting my lips, I left the music room.
