      <p>After a while of looking at the statue, Rime spoke up. "Look! There's another memory egg here." She pointed between the feet of the two statues, where a memory egg twinkled ever so slightly.
        "I wonder if the memory egg was worshipped along with the two statues."
        If that's true, then the information it holds might be of considerable importance. With that thought in mind, I picked up the egg. But the moment I touched it, a tremendous force took hold of my body, and forced itself into my head. Instead of a scene playing out in my hand, 3 fragmented pictures of sceneries with a tremendous quantity of text streamed into my mind. The characters danced around, so dense and numerous it was like a black storm. Then some would briefly settle into lines of text before scattering again. The first line I was able to make out seemed like a title of sorts.
        --"Memoirs of a Witch"--
        The title of that which was overflowing and pouring out from the memory egg.</p>
