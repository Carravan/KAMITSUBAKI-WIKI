</div><p>I might be able to make a friend to sing with. The thought made me practically lean forward in curiosity and excitement.<br>
"So, what are they like? The new witches."<br>
"They're from the same period of time as you are. And they all love singing. I will send you their current whereabouts."<br>
I immediately received the location of three of the girls. Well, at least that's what I figured. The actual text was garbled beyond recognition.<br>
"Hey Restoration Department? What's with this garbled text?"<br>
"We are so■■y, it appears that the ■■■■ of the transmission is fa■■ty. We will ■■ ■■ touch."<br>
The connection with the Restoration Department was cut off at the end.<br>
"Oh come on, not again..."<br>
Looks like the Internet connection sucks as usual.<br>
The infrastructure of the city tends to break down with the rest of it. It's hard to find good reception. But now, of all times?<br>
(How long until I have a signal again, I wonder...)<br>
I can't just sit here and wait. I've wanted this ever since I came to the city.<br>
The text might be all garbled up, but there are still some clues about their whereabouts in there. With that, I can start looking for them.<br>
"The first location seems to be Kamitsubaki City's first district. Guess I'll start off there."<br>
With the whisper parting my lips, I left the music room.</p><div>

        As if someone was calling out to me,<br>
        I opened my eyes.<br>

        What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.<br>
        Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.<br>
        <br>
        During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.<br>
        I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,<br>
        It felt like I was losing something important......<br>
        <br>
        With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.<br>
        The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.<br>
        <br>
        A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.<br>
        Though the buildings were sooty,<br>
        and some collapsed here and there.<br>
        The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,<br>
        and an enormous blue bird was flying around.<br>
        <br>
        A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world<br>
        ------ “Kamitsubaki City”<br>
        That’s where I currently reside.<br>
