      <p>I might be able to make a friend to sing with. <br>
      The thought made me practically lean forward in curiosity and excitement.<br>
      "So, what are they like? The new witches."<br>
      "They're from the same period of time as you are. And they all love singing. I will send you their current whereabouts."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      I immediately received the location of three of the girls. Well, at least that's what I figured. The actual text was garbled beyond recognition.<br>
      "Hey Restoration Department? What's with this garbled text?"<br>
      "We are so■■y, it appears that the ■■■■ of the transmission is fa■■ty. We will ■■ ■■ touch."<br>
      The connection with the Restoration Department was cut off at the end.<br>
      "Oh come on, not again..."<br>
      Looks like the Internet connection sucks as usual.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      The infrastructure of the city tends to break down with the rest of it. It's hard to find good reception. But now, of all times?<br>
      (How long until I have a signal again, I wonder...)<br>
      I can't just sit here and wait. I've wanted this ever since I came to the city.<br>
      The text might be all garbled up, but there are still some clues about their whereabouts in there. With that, I can start looking for them.<br>
      "The first location seems to be Kamitsubaki City's first district. Guess I'll start off there."<br>
      With the whisper parting my lips, I left the music room.</p>
