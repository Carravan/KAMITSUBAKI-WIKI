      <p>That you're reading this means you probably already know. This city is brimming with mystery. Just about everything happening in this city is virtually incomprehensible; to enlighten every nook and corner a nigh impossibility. I've scoured countless books of the Akashic Library in my time, accumulated a colossal wealth of knowledge, and yet even to me its mysteries remained as such. Mysteries. 
        However, a single thing has become crystal clear to me: the reason behind the city's destruction and the disappearance of its residents. At its heart lies the phenomenon where the sky is dyed black that occasionally manifests in this city. The phenomenon occurs when the combined thought fragments flowing into the city from the real world satisfy the right conditions. If these conditions are met, the shadows haunting this city can begin to physically manifest. The city is then annihilated in the ensuing attack by these manifested shadows. Most likely, this outcome has already repeated many, many times. 

        The Restoration Department should be aware of this fact. They hid this from me and chose to summon me into this world all the same.</p>
