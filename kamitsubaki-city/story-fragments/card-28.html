        The moment I touched the sphere, a strange scene poured into my head. <br>
        Noisy, grainy and unclear, and yet like a memory, it felt so vivid, so real to my mind.<br>
        The scene played out against a cityscape... this city's scape. <br>
        Only it had fallen even more into ruin. There was hardly a building left standing. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perched atop a pile of debris stood a single girl, motionless. She was facing me with her back, so I couldn't make out her face, unfortunately. <br>
        She couldn't have spoken with anyone but herself as she raised her head toward the sky and whispered. <br>
        "So this is why the city has fallen to ruin... That's why everyone is gone..."<br>
        Following her line of sight, my eyes settled on a grand, blue bird. <br>
        The sky around it was dyed pitch black.<br>
