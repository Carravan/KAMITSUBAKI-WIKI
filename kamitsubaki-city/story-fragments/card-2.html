    <div></div><p>My name is Morisaki Kaf (森先化歩). I was born in the "real world", from where one day I was summoned to come here. I'm the first person.</p><div>
    </div><p>I say that, but it's not really anything so special. Before coming here, I've been a normal student. I lived in a suburban city in Japan and spent my time like any other person.</p><div>
    </div><p>The only part that might stand out about me is that I like songs. I like listening to them, sure, but more than that, I love singing them. Day after day, I just kept singing by myself, songs meant for no one to hear.</p><div>
    </div><p>Then one day, I received a strange message.</p><div>
    </div><p>"Dear Miss Morisaki Kaf,<br>
    I write to you on behalf of the Kamitsubaki City Restoration Department.<br>
    Though it pains us do so, we ask for your cooperation in the redevelopment of Kamitsubaki City.<br>
    The restoration of said city requires your abilities."</p><div>
    </div><p>When I first saw the message, I didn't really understand what it meant. Still confused, the sender said they would guide me to Kamitsubaki City.</p><div>
    </div><p>That moment–<br>
    My body was engulfed in pillars of light,<br>
    and like in a dream, the scenery around me began to sway.</p><div>
    </div><p>The next moment, I found myself alone, surrounded by the ruins of that Kamitsubaki City. That is how I came to be in this place so unlike my own reality, in a separate world.</p><div>
    </div><p>It almost felt like I was spirited away, just like that. The sender of that message, the Restoration Department, seems to possess some kind of power that allows them to transport people from the real world into this virtual world. Almost like magic...</p><div>
