    <div></div><p>My name is Morisaki Kaf (森先化歩). 
    I was born in the "real world", from where one day I was summoned to come here. I'm the first person.</p><div>
    <br>
    </div><p>I say that, but it's not really anything so special. <br>
    Before coming here, I've been a normal student. <br>
    I lived in a suburban city in Japan and spent my time like any other person.</p><div>
    </div><p>The only part that might stand out about me is that I like songs. <br>
    I like listening to them, sure, but more than that, I love singing them. <br>
    Day after day, I just kept singing by myself, songs meant for no one to hear.</p><div>
    <br>
    </div><p>Then one day, I received a strange message.</p><div>
    </div><p>"Dear Miss Morisaki Kaf,<br>
    I write to you on behalf of the Kamitsubaki City Restoration Department.<br>
    Though it pains us do so, we ask for your cooperation in the redevelopment of Kamitsubaki City.<br>
    The restoration of said city requires your abilities."</p><div>
    <br>
    </div><p>When I first saw the message, I didn't really understand what it meant. <br>
    Still confused, the sender said they would guide me to Kamitsubaki City.</p><div>
    </div><p>That moment–<br>
    My body was engulfed in pillars of light,<br>
    and like in a dream, the scenery around me began to sway.</p><div>
    <br>
    </div><p>The next moment, I found myself alone, surrounded by the ruins of that Kamitsubaki City. <br>
    That is how I came to be in this place so unlike my own reality, in a separate world.</p><div>
    </div><p>It almost felt like I was spirited away, just like that. <br>
    The sender of that message, the Restoration Department, seems to possess some kind of power that allows them to transport people from the real world into this virtual world. <br>
    Almost like magic...</p><div>
