		<p>Rime and I arrive at the Second District. By the time we reached here, the sun had already set. <br>
    The city submerged in twilight.<br>
      It was a red-light district lit with colourful neon lights. The streets were dazzling, and the atmosphere was pretty lively. <br>
      This area was different from the First District, many people were coming and going.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      “There’s this many people…?! I wonder if they’re people who came from the real world.”<br>
      “Seems so. But everyone’s so bounderish.”<br>
      I agreed with Rime. It looked like there were many delinquents in the Second District. <br>
      I wonder if these kinds of people sprawl out amidst the crowd.<br>
      Even when I was in the real world, I never came to this kind of city.<br>
      This is scary, what if we accidentally get involved with them…<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rime held onto my trembling hand.<br>
      “It’s gonna be fine Kaf, I’m here with you.”<br>
      She looked so gallant and reliable as she said that.<br>
      I squeezed back on her hand, and we continued our steps in the Second District.</p><div>
