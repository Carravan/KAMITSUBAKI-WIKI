        A small, black shape floated in the middle of the sky. <br>
        From its surface, it dropped like ink and began to spread out in the blink of an eye. <br>
        We all saw the same scene, it seemed, as they raised their voices.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "W-what? The sky is turning black!?"<br>
        "This feels ominous."<br>
        "Kaf, did anything like this happen before?"<br>
        I shook my head at Rime's question. It's been quite a while now since I came here, but I've never seen anything like it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        As the sky's hue turned darker and darker, the birds from before began to rampage through the sky. <br>
        They were so high up they couldn't see what was going on exactly, but the birds cried out as they dropped to the ground the ground.<br>
        "What the fuck is going on!? We should check this out!" <br>
        Following Haru's idea, we dashed toward the fallen birds. <br>
        A confused, uncertain chase.<br>
