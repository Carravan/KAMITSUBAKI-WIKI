        The place the birds fell seemed to be close to an abandoned building at the edge of the zeroth district. <br>
        We hurried over there as fast as we could... but when we arrived, there was nothing to be found.<br>
        "They're... gone? But I'm sure they fell right around here..."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We looked inside and around the building, but there was not even a trace of the birds to be found. <br>
        All the while, the sky seemed to regain its color and brightness.<br>
        "The sky's color is back to normal, too... What did we just witness?"<br>
        None of us knew how the answer to that question. But in turn, I found something strange. <br>
        "Huh? What's this?"<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of me lay a glass sphere, approximately 20cm across, and twinkling with light. <br>
        It was almost like a snow-dome. Inside stood a miniature diorama of a city.<br>
        Perhaps this is somehow related to the bird event just now?<br>
        Without a thought, I picked up the glass sphere. <br>
        And as I touched the sphere, one more strange thing occurred.<br>
