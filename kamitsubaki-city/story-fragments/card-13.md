*Translation by Vaynonym*

We were walking around the chaotic second district. With the district as loud as it is, I doubt it'll be possibly to follow her singing like how I found Rime. That's why I jumped over my shadow and decided to ask a person on the street.
"I'm sorry, do you happen to know of a girl that likes songs in the vicinity?"
As I did, an elderly lady turned around, and answered bluntly.
"A girl that likes songs? There're a dime in a dozen, my dear, a dime in a dozen."
Seeing her face distort in annoyance, I felt despondent. In my place, Rime continued.
"Unfortunately, our information is somewhat limited, but we know she's about our age. And she doesn't just listen to songs, she sings herself."
"A girl that sings... now that you mention it, back at the intersection over there, there was a young street musician over there. I think she was singing... rap, they call it, don't they? Maybe that's your girl."
We turned our faces to each other and smiled. That's gotta be a huge lead.
"Thank you very much, lady!"
Rime and I bowed our heads. "Glad to help," the lady smiled. She might've been blunt, but she seemed like a good person at heart.
We parted ways with the older lady and headed toward the intersection she told us about. As we set foot into the crowd, we heard someone singing.
