      <p>And so began our search for the memory eggs. Just like the boy told us, they seemed to be scattered around the city here and there. In the shadow of a building. In the depths of a back-alley. Even in the school we found one.
        Any moment we weren't singing toward the real world, we were searching for memory eggs. By connecting the memories we got our hands on that way, we were slowly but surely able to piece together some of the city's past. 
        There really had been people here, back then. Besides the girl we had already seen in the first memory egg, there were many others we observed. 
        A girl perched atop a high tower, eyes drawn to the moon. A boy out on a journey to leave the bounds of the city. A crying man, clutching the hand of a woman fallen asleep.
        None of them were summoned to this world. I assume they were the original inhabitants of the city. When we touched their memory eggs, it wasn't just their memories that were playing out in our mind. It was something more. Their thoughts, their wishes. Their heart.
        And like that, we compiled the memories of the people now gone. 
        One day, when the five of us were walking around the third district, Koko spoke like she was pondering aloud. "We've thoroughly confirmed that there were people originally living here... but we're not one step closer to figuring out why they disappeared, huh."</p>
