        "W-what?!"
        As she opened the door of the Western style building, Haru's surprise was quite audible. 
				Looking through the entrance, we saw a great pillar of light manifest in the reception hall.
        We lingered like this for a moment, before eventually the shape of a person emerged from the light. 
        At the same time, the light seemed to fade, and finally give way to the composed face of a young woman.
        ".....So this must be Kamitsubaki City. And you, the witches."
      </p>
      <p>
        The young woman narrowed her eyes to look at us. She was pretty, with a more adult vibe to her. 
        Even so, her face was kind. Rime still looked somewhat lost as she started talking to her.
        " We-were you summoned here...?""
        "You are correct. My name is Rinne Koko. I came at the request of the Restoration Department."
        Her answer was calm and collected. 
        To my surprise, my smartphone rang. "Your ringtone? A message from the Restoration Department?" I quickly confirmed as much.
        "Well, well! The whole crew assembled at last. With all of you finally united, even I get a little sentimental."
        Against any expectation, the message was weirdly amicable and care-free. A little astonished, I answered.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We just found her, someone named Koko. Is this really everyone this time?"
        "That's right. This is all of them. All the witches I currently identified."
        I suppose this means Koko must possess the same mysterious power we do. The Restoration Department's messages continue.
        "From now on, I would like you to lavish the power of your singing to attract many more people to Kamitsubaki City. 
        I may be asking a lot of you, but yours is the only power we can rely on."
        "Hold on a sec. Do Sekai and Koko know? That they can't return to the real world until all Qs have been solved?"
        Sekai and Koko step in to answer instead.
        "Yeah, I do. It sounded interesting, so I figured why not and came here." 
        "I heard about it, too. But my desire to help you people was stronger."
        I was relieved to hear their response. The Restoration Department went on. 
        "It was not my intention to deceive you. If you wish to return no matter what, simply speak to me and I will see to the necessary arrangements."
        "Wait, really? That puts me at ease..."
        "Ah, it a■■ears the transmission quality is taking a turn for the worse ag■■n. 
        There's a lot I still wi■h to explain, but ■■■ the m■■ent, I'm afraid our time ■■ cut short. I will contact you ag■■n."
        And with that, reception was cut off. Rime sighed as she looked at the message.
        "I have the sneaking suspicion that the guy's just running off when things get uncomfortable..."
        "But I'm glad we found another friend. Welcome to Kamitsubaki City, Koko."
        When I said that, Koko smiled warmly. "I'm glad to meet all of you. We're going to do great."
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's how all five of us came to meet in Kamitsubaki City. The first time the fated five friends gathered together.
