        "W-what?!"<br>
        As she opened the door of the Western style building, Haru's surprise was quite audible.<br>
				Looking through the entrance, we saw a great pillar of light manifest in the reception hall.<br>
        We lingered like this for a moment, before eventually the shape of a person emerged from the light. <br>
        At the same time, the light seemed to fade, and finally give way to the composed face of a young woman.<br>
        ".....So this must be Kamitsubaki City. And you, the witches."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The young woman narrowed her eyes to look at us. She was pretty, with a more adult vibe to her. <br>
        Even so, her face was kind. Rime still looked somewhat lost as she started talking to her.<br>
        " We-were you summoned here...?""<br>
        "You are correct. My name is Rinne Koko. I came at the request of the Restoration Department."<br>
        Her answer was calm and collected. <br>
        To my surprise, my smartphone rang. "Your ringtone? A message from the Restoration Department?" I quickly confirmed as much.<br>
        "Well, well! The whole crew assembled at last. With all of you finally united, even I get a little sentimental."<br>
        Against any expectation, the message was weirdly amicable and care-free. A little astonished, I answered.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "We just found her, someone named Koko. Is this really everyone this time?"<br>
        "That's right. This is all of them. All the witches I currently identified."<br>
        I suppose this means Koko must possess the same mysterious power we do. The Restoration Department's messages continue.<br>
        "From now on, I would like you to lavish the power of your singing to attract many more people to Kamitsubaki City. <br>
        I may be asking a lot of you, but yours is the only power we can rely on."<br>
        "Hold on a sec. Do Sekai and Koko know? That they can't return to the real world until all Qs have been solved?"<br>
        Sekai and Koko step in to answer instead.<br>
        "Yeah, I do. It sounded interesting, so I figured why not and came here." <br>
        "I heard about it, too. But my desire to help you people was stronger."<br>
        I was relieved to hear their response. The Restoration Department went on. <br>
        "It was not my intention to deceive you. If you wish to return no matter what, simply speak to me and I will see to the necessary arrangements."<br>
        "Wait, really? That puts me at ease..."<br>
        "Ah, it a■■ears the transmission quality is taking a turn for the worse ag■■n. <br>
        There's a lot I still wi■h to explain, but ■■■ the m■■ent, I'm afraid our time ■■ cut short. I will contact you ag■■n."<br>
        And with that, reception was cut off. Rime sighed as she looked at the message.<br>
        "I have the sneaking suspicion that the guy's just running off when things get uncomfortable..."<br>
        "But I'm glad we found another friend. Welcome to Kamitsubaki City, Koko."<br>
        When I said that, Koko smiled warmly. "I'm glad to meet all of you. We're going to do great."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's how all five of us came to meet in Kamitsubaki City. The first time the fated five friends gathered together.<br>

    <p><i>This name is a pun again, with Koko's name sounding identical to and using the same kanji as the Japanese word for "here."</i></p>
