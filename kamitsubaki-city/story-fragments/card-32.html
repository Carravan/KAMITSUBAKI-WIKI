      <p>It was just like Koko said. We had seen memory after memory of the former inhabitants of the city, and yet, eerily, there was not a single one that related to their disappearance. 
        Haru seemed to have taken an interest as well. "It's strange, really. Are we supposed to believe that one day, the inhabitants just vanished without warning?"
        Rime spent a moment in thought before answering. "It just doesn't feel fight to me. Because remember. In the very first egg, the girl talked about the cause of the city's fall to ruin."
        She was right. In the memory, the girl looked at the sky dyed black and whispered "so this is why the city has fallen to ruin." There was no doubt about that, at least. Something happened in this city, the city was destroyed, and the inhabitants all disappeared.
        "The problem is that we can't find any memories relating to the cause of it. It'd be nice if we could find more memories of that girl..."
        "Wait, everyone," Sekai suddenly said. "I can feel something from that building over there."
        We followed her eyes and settled ours on a church-like building surrounded by dense mist. 
        I had already mentioned her divination, but it seems like besides singing, there is just some mysterious power about Sekai. Because it's her, we believed her without a second thought.
        "Alright then. Let's do this."
        We nodded to each other and headed to the building.
