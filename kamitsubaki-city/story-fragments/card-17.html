        However, as we searched for our fourth comrade, we wound up completely and thoroughly lost instead. <br>
        Wandering in the mist, we started muttering to each other.<br>
        "J-just where the hell are we....? The mist is just about everywhere. There's nothing else to see but yet more mist. Sometimes fog..."<br>
        "It's going to be alright, Kaf. We just have to start by figuring out where we are right now." <br>

        As she said so, Haru whipped out her smartphone and opened Maps. But her face quickly darkened. <br>
        "...This is weird. It's not showing any map."<br>
        "Maybe because it's from the real world? I doubt even the company's quasi-monopole gives them any claim here."<br>
        "Oh well, that's how it goes. But it is unfortunate... I don't see how we can find our comrade like this."<br>
        Right when Haru was finished, someone's voice started behind us.<br>
        "You do seem to be in quite the pinch."<br>
        We turned around, to find against the uncertain backdrop of mist and a Western-style house, the shape of a person.<br>
