<p><em>Translation by Vaynonym</em></p><div>
</div><p>At that moment, my phone rang. Who knows how long it's been in my pocket since it last saw any use. It's from the Restoration Department.<br>
"Dear Kaf, we assume that you must be feeling a sense of solitude? In that case, we bring a fortunate announcement."<br>
They responded like they could hear my muttering. That's just how they are. No matter where I am, it seems they can always hear me. I answered them, trying not to let my embarrassment show.<br>
"You may rejoice! A new witch has come to the city.<br>
It was almost breathtaking, hearing that. "Really!? Did you summon them from the real world?!"<br>
"Yes. They possess the same power you do. The power to reach the people from the real world and stir their hearts with their singing."<br>
According to the Restoration Department, those that possess that power are called witches.<br>
The power to pour your own feelings into a song and share them with others. A song imbued with feelings like that can cross the boundary between worlds and reach into the real world.<br>
I thought that was my own special magic. It never occurred to me that there might be others.<br>
"So I finally don't have to sing alone anymore!"<br>
With that thought filling my mind, I couldn't help but smile to myself. It's only starting to dawn on me now, but I must've been much more lonely than I thought.</p><div>
