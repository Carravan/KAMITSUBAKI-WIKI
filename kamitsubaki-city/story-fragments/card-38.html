      <p>I came back to myself after the final words fell. My body was shaking from the frightening experience, the dreadful story. Everyone else seemed surprise and looked over to me. 
        Sekai seemed a little worried. "A-are you okay? You looked like you went through something painful."
        But I did not have the words to explain what I just went through. I could only mutter the words "look at that memory egg" in reply.
        One by one, everyone touched the memory egg; one by one, everyone came back with a terrified look. 
        They all must have seen the same thing. The Tragedy of a Witch. The sad final moments of a person like us, a person deeply in love with singing summoned her to save the city.
        When Rime finished, she looked deeply concerned. "W-what does this mean?! We aren't the first people to be summoned here from the real world?"</p>
