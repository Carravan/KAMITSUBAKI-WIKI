      <p>"If we can't run, then we just gotta face them head-on." Haru's word resonated in Yorukawa Sekai's chest and took hold of her. From the moment she laid eyes on the enormous swarm of Tesseracts, Sekai was certain. She would be devoured. The whole city would be devoured. Even without divination, that much is clear. Our future was always heading for tragedy.
        Even if they gave up on their duty as witches and returned to the real world, the result would be the same. Whatever path they may choose, their future was cast in darkness.
        I was never able to tell them. I didn't want to believe my own power.
        That's why Sekai kept that fact a secret from everyone else. To preserve what happy days they had left. But what awaited them would be exactly what she saw in her divination. 
        That was their fate. Implacable, immutable. A fact. Or so she thought. That's why Haru's words resonated with her. Her strong will, the idea that they can face their fate head-on and smash it to pieces. Courage was slowly building inside Sekai's chest. She turned to her friends. "It's just as Haru says, everyone. Instead of running, I'm sure we'll have better odds facing it head-on."
        "Oh, you think so, too, Sekai?"
        "Our story isn't finished just yet! There has to be a way. I'm sure of it. We can change fate itself!"</p>
