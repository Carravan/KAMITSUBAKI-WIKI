        The next morning, our little group, now bolstered with Haru, started searching the third district. <br>
        According to the Restoration Department's message, the fourth witch should be there. <br>
        The third district was again different from any we had seen previously.
      </p>
      <p>
        The street were framed with nothing but ruins and abandoned building. The district was completely destroyed. <br>
        The whole area was covered in a thick mist, and deep inside, there was a silhouette of some kind of mysterious shine, <br>
        or perhaps a church or some old, Western-styled building. <br>
        Haru and Rime were chatting while we were walking around.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is my first time coming here, but I have to wonder, why's the mist so thick in the district?"<br>
        "There's a mountain north of here. The mist forms there, and from there finds its way down into the district."<br>
        "That so? You sure know your stuff, Rime!"<br>
        "Ever since coming here, I've been studying up about the city. But it's pretty hard to find someone in the middle of this fog."<br>
        Despite her saying so, she kept searching earnestly. Meanwhile, Haru and I tried to rekindle her spirit.<br>
