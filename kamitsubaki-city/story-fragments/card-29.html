        "H-huh!?"<br>
        I returned to my senses, and to Rime's surprised voice. <br>
        "What happened to you!?"<br>
        "J-just now... The moment I touched this, I saw some kind of scene before me."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone seemed puzzled. Wondering what I meant with "scene," Rime touched the glistening glass sphere. <br>
        She shook like some force ran through her body. <br>
        "Y-you're right... I saw it too. But rather than "before me," the scene almost seemed to play out inside my mind... or something like that?"<br>
        The other three followed suit and touched the sphere one after the other. But the result was always the same. <br>
        "It's so strange... even in my divination I couldn't see anything like it."<br>
        Even Sekai seemed to be thoroughly puzzled. Her head was ever so slightly titled to the right. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        As she did so, a boy walking around the city started talking to us.<br>
        "Don't you people know? This is a memory egg."<br>
