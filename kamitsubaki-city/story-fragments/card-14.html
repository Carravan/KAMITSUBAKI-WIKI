			<p>We came to an abrupt stop. A single girl sang underneath a neon street light.<br>
        She was a little older than us, and taller. The moment we listened to her song, I got goosebumps. <br>
        It felt like everything she bottled up is violently let free inside the song. Her voice was searing. <br>
        Her passion, her desire, her deep love, all coalescing in her rap―
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no doubt about it. She is the third witch. We waited for her to finish the song before talking to her.<br>
        "Hey, uhm.... That was amazing!"<br>
        "Huh? T-thank you. I've been singing here ever since I came to this city, but this is the first time anyone praised me like that."<br>
        She looked to us with a shy smile. That's when Rime asked,<br>
        "How should we call you?"<br>
        "Me? I'm Asanushi Haru. Haru's fine, though."<br>
        A sweet smile covered her face from one side to the other. The girl named Haru. Her eyes were indomitable, her determination radiant.<br>
