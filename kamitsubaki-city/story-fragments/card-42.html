      <p>We finally arrived at the location the message mentioned. We entered the abandoned building and continued underground following the stairs. Before we could descend all the way, a locked iron door blocked our way. But as if it knew we were coming, the lock simply opened by itself. We quickly exchanged glances before opening the door. Inside, we found ourselves in a wide, cold place. And in the center of that room—
        "T-thats....!"
        I couldn't form the thought. Before me was one of the large blue birds that roamed the skies of Kamitsubaki City. It's body was littered in wounds. One of its wings was smashed. What's one of these birds doing in here? 
        I was still grappling with the situation when it looked at us and opened its beak. "So you came, young witches... It it unfortunate that... this... is how we speak face to face for the first time."
        """""IT CAN SPEAK!?"""""
        Somehow, all of our voiced aligned perfectly in our surprise. But I did remember that voice all too well. We could hardly believe our eyes. "Y-you're the Restoration Department...?!?"
        The bird's eyes narrowed. Its voice resembled a woman's. "At last we see each other. I'm the central information collection device of the Kamitsubaki City Restoration Program. I'm also known under the codename Restoration Department."</p>
