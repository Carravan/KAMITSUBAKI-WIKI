        In front of the Western-styled building, clad in her entirely white uniform, stood a delicately pretty girl. <br>
        The mist cleared up without notice as the girl spoke with a soft voice.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Kaf, Rime, and finally Haru. I've been waiting for you for a long, long time."<br>
        "Wait... you know who we are?" I blurted out the question with a thought, but the girl simply nodded. <br>
        "It came to me by divination... That you desired comrades, and that you would come here in your search."<br>
        "Comrade... wait, that means thatâ€•"<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The word caught me by surprise and wouldn't let me go. She nodded again.<br>
        "That's right. I'm the fourth. My name is Yorukawa Sekai. I'm glad to have found you."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(The title seems like a pun in Japanese, being Isekai Yori, meaning literally what is translated above, <br>
        but also seemingly being a pun on Yorukawa Sekai's name. <br>
        It could also be reasonably interpreted as "another Sekai", or "a strange Sekai", Sekai being the name of the character in that reading.) </i>
