<div class="content">
  <div class="text">
      <p>As if someone was calling out to me,<br>
      I opened my eyes.</p><div>
      </div><p>What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.<br>
      Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.</p><div>
      </div><p>During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.<br>
      I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,<br>
      It felt like I was losing something important......</p><div>
      </div><p>With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.<br>
      The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.</p><div>
      </div><p>A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.<br>
      Though the buildings were sooty,<br>
      and some collapsed here and there.<br>
      The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,<br>
      and an enormous blue bird was flying around.</p><div>
      </div><p>A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world<br>
      ------ “Kamitsubaki City”<br>
      That’s where I currently reside.</p>
