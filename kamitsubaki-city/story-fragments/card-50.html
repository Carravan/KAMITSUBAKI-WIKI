      <p>It seems my feelings reached everyone. This is our way of fighting back. Rime, Haru, Sekai, Koko. All of them smiled.
        "Exactly. This is the weapon we wield."
        "Yeah. I'm a bit shocked our audience consists of fish, though."
        "It's alright. Our actual audience resides in another world. The people we are trying to reach with our songs."
        "... you're right. That's why we came to this city all along, isn't it? To reach the people from the real world with our songs."
        Even so, I'm sure we will be the only ones without salvation. Us powerless witches. Unless, perhaps if people decide to come to this city, knowing full well the truth of this place... perhaps then, together with new friends, we may yet shape a different future... Whatever fate may hold in store for you, nothing is absolute. I'm sure now that you can change its path.
        With that belief, we stare somewhere far, far away. Toward a world not here, but another one. Toward the people that reside there—
        "Let it extend all the way there, our song."
        And that's how we began to sing. From this world, to you, living in the real world. From a small corner of the ruins of Kamitsubaki City, our song resonates.</p>
