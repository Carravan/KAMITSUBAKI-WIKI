      <p>The swarm of Tesseracts devoured anything in its path. Buildings. The people in the city. Everything. Tanioki Rime was in disbelief
        "This can't be happening..." she thought. "Is this what that witch of the memoirs saw in her final moments?!"
        Rime was always composed, but even her thoughts were in pieces now, scattered far and wide. The situation was beyond her wildest dreams. Her heart gave out. It was only the sight of her friends that brought her back from the brink. "You have to calm down, Rime!" She thought to herself. "It's been nothing but strange and weird things happening ever since you came here. This is hardly different!" So she told herself as she firmly grabbed Kaf's hand and finally opened her mouth. Her voice managed to cut through the bedlam. "Let's go, everyone. We have to head somewhere safe."
        "Y-yeah!" 
        The others nodded and dashed onward. But in their path surged the deluge of Tesseracts. They kept running and running, but doubt rose to the surface of Rime's mind. "Run where, exactly? Is there even a place where we can weather the storm?" The witch from the memoirs was unable to find one. Why would it be different for them? Will this be what she leaves behind, a memory egg brimming with doubt and uncertainty?
        Rime knew no answer to the questions racing inside her mind. All she could do was keep running. Keep running, keep running, and outrace the doubt.</p>
