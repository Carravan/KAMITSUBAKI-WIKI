<p><em>Translation by Saeka</em></p><div>
</div><p>After I met Rime, my dull daily life became fun in a heartbeat. Even the school that I always went to alone, I now have a friend that goes there with me.<br>
There weren’t any other students or teachers around but still, it was nice to have a place where I could meet with my friend. The desolated school that was sort of like our secret hideout felt really cozy.<br>
And the days of the two of us singing in the music room beganー<br>
One of those days, Rime asked a question that suddenly came to her mind.<br>
“By the way, Kaf. Are there any other girls that Kamitsubaki City summoned, other than me?<br>
“Ah, now that you mention it, there indeed are others!”<br>
I forgot about it from the joy of meeting Rime, but the address list that the Restoration Department sent me was indeed for three people. Which means there were two more that were summoned.<br>
“...But the addresses that were sent by the Restoration Department are all garbled up and unreadable… I can just barely make out that they’re in the Second District and Third District respectively.”<br>
“Half-baked as usual huh. Hey Restoration Department? Won't you give us the precise locations?”<br>
Rime asked aloud out the window, but there was no response from the Restoration Department. I started to think they’re just having fun messing with us.<br>
“...I guess it can’t be helped. For now, why don’t we try to search for those two with the information we have at hand?”<br>
“Yeah. It’d be nice to have more friends too.”<br>
We both nod in agreement and headed out of the classroom, to go to the Second District, where our next friend should be.</p><div>
