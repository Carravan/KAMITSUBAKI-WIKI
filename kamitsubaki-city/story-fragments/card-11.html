      <p>After I met Rime, my dull daily life became fun in a heartbeat. <br>
      Even the school that I always went to alone, I now have a friend that goes there with me.<br>
      There weren’t any other students or teachers around but still, it was nice to have a place where I could meet with my friend. <br>
      The desolated school that was sort of like our secret hideout felt really cozy.<br>
      And the days of the two of us singing in the music room beganー<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      One of those days, Rime asked a question that suddenly came to her mind.<br>
      “By the way, Kaf. Are there any other girls that Kamitsubaki City summoned, other than me?<br>
      “Ah, now that you mention it, there indeed are others!”<br>
      I forgot about it from the joy of meeting Rime, but the address list that the Restoration Department sent me was indeed for three people. <br>
      Which means there were two more that were summoned.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      “...But the addresses that were sent by the Restoration Department are all garbled up and unreadable… <br>
      I can just barely make out that they’re in the Second District and Third District respectively.”<br>
      “Half-baked as usual huh. Hey Restoration Department? Won't you give us the precise locations?”<br>
      Rime asked aloud out the window, but there was no response from the Restoration Department. <br>
        I started to think they’re just having fun messing with us.<br>
      “...I guess it can’t be helped. For now, why don’t we try to search for those two with the information we have at hand?”<br>
      “Yeah. It’d be nice to have more friends too.”<br>
      We both nod in agreement and headed out of the classroom, to go to the Second District, where our next friend should be.</p>
