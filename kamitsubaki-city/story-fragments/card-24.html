        Our course of action decided, we began the search for the Restoration Department and the quest of uncovering the city's past. 
        We left the school and walked around the zeroth district. While the city was filled with people, the shops and houses were vacant. 
        Even the city's biggest department store was without a single employee present. 
        Instead, someone had left a big note that read, "Please help yourself to anything you'd like."

        "Does this mean some kind of disaster befell the city and everyone evacuated?"
        Rime answered Haru. 
        "It seems likely, at least. If that's the case, then a lot of time must have passed." 
        She held a worn tape recorder taken from the storefront of the tenant's electronics shop. 
        "Take a look at this. The model is much older than any presently used in the real world. 
        The casing's already deteriorated quite a bit, too. 
        The fact that this is displayed at the storefront makes me think it must have been years."

        We could only agree with Rime's analysis. If we keep gathering clues like this, we'll slowly start to unravel what befell this city. 
        "Great going! Let's take a look at the other shops, too." The conversation went on as we left the shop.
