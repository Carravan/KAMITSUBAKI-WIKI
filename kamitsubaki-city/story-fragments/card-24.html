        Our course of action decided, we began the search for the Restoration Department and the quest of uncovering the city's past. <br>
        We left the school and walked around the zeroth district. While the city was filled with people, the shops and houses were vacant. <br>
        Even the city's biggest department store was without a single employee present. <br>
        Instead, someone had left a big note that read, "Please help yourself to anything you'd like."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Does this mean some kind of disaster befell the city and everyone evacuated?"<br>
        Rime answered Haru. <br>
        "It seems likely, at least. If that's the case, then a lot of time must have passed." <br>
        She held a worn tape recorder taken from the storefront of the tenant's electronics shop. <br>
        "Take a look at this. The model is much older than any presently used in the real world. <br>
        The casing's already deteriorated quite a bit, too. <br>
        The fact that this is displayed at the storefront makes me think it must have been years."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We could only agree with Rime's analysis. If we keep gathering clues like this, we'll slowly start to unravel what befell this city. <br>
        "Great going! Let's take a look at the other shops, too." <br>
        The conversation went on as we left the shop.<br>
