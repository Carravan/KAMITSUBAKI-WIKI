<p><em>Translation by Vaynonym</em></p><div>
</div><p>—How much time has passed since that day, I wonder. I've been singing in Kamitsubaki City ever since.</p><div>
</div><p>Following the promise I made with the Restoration Department, I can't return to the original world until the restoration of the city is complete. In exchange, I'm provided everything I need to live by the Restoration Department.</p><div>
</div><p>Thanks to that, I could focus solely on singing. Like any other day, I singing vibrantly starting early in the morning. Remembering how I lived before this, I break out into laughter.</p><div>
</div><p>(At first, I had my doubts whether I could actually reach people from the real word just by singing........)</p><div>
</div><p>The restoration department seemed rather dubious to me anyway. I didn't mind putting my all into restoring the city. That wasn't the issue. I just had a feeling they were deceiving me somehow.</p><div>
</div><p>Even so, I kept singing, and after some time, little by little more people appeared in the city. It really did happen, what the restoration department told me.</p><div>
</div><p>Even right now, I can see the people that came to this world walking around and solving the Qs. This ghost town of a city has actually become fairly busy.</p><div>
</div><p>"But man, I can't help but feel a little lonely. I wish there were others like me, singing."</p><div>
</div><p>I'm the only person that even goes to this school. I have no one to call my friends. Singing alone like this, day in day out, I guess it's only natural I feel a sense of solitude.</p><div>

        As if someone was calling out to me,<br>
        I opened my eyes.<br>

        What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.<br>
        Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.<br>
        <br>
        During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.<br>
        I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,<br>
        It felt like I was losing something important......<br>
        <br>
        With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.<br>
        The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.<br>
        <br>
        A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.<br>
        Though the buildings were sooty,<br>
        and some collapsed here and there.<br>
        The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,<br>
        and an enormous blue bird was flying around.<br>
        <br>
        A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world<br>
        ------ “Kamitsubaki City”<br>
        That’s where I currently reside.<br>
