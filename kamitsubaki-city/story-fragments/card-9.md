*Translation by Saeka*

Someone’s singing!
The moment I realised that, I continued on my tracks.
That’s right, the Restoration Department talked about this too, that the new residents were girls who love singing. They possess the same power as I do, singers whose voices can reach the real world.
I’m sure I’ll be able to meet this girl if I pursue her singing.
As if it was an invitation, I kept going.
Eventually, I arrived at a spacious square. There was a figure of a blue haired girl singing by herself.
“......!”
I stood in place, charmed by her song.
Oblivious of my presence, she immersed herself in singing. A sweet and powerful deep voice.
Soon after she finished her song, I applauded without much thought.
“A-amazing! What an amazing and pretty song!”
I was so impressed to the point where my vocabulary had been thrown out the window.
The girl shuddered in shock and looked at my way.
“Eh-... W-who’s there?”
“I am Kaf. I like songsー Err, what else...? Self introductions are kinda hard.”
“Ah! You’re the girl that the Restoration Department spoke of!”
She said as she ran up to me with a smile on her face.
“I’m Rime. Tanioki Rime (谷置狸眼). I’m the same as you, who got called and summoned here from the real world by the Restoration Department.”
