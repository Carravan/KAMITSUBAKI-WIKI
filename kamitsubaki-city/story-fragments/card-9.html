</div><p>Someone’s singing!<br>
The moment I realised that, I continued on my tracks.<br>
That’s right, the Restoration Department talked about this too, that the new residents were girls who love singing. They possess the same power as I do, singers whose voices can reach the real world.<br>
I’m sure I’ll be able to meet this girl if I pursue her singing.<br>
As if it was an invitation, I kept going.<br>
Eventually, I arrived at a spacious square. There was a figure of a blue haired girl singing by herself.<br>
“......!”<br>
I stood in place, charmed by her song.<br>
Oblivious of my presence, she immersed herself in singing. A sweet and powerful deep voice.<br>
Soon after she finished her song, I applauded without much thought.<br>
“A-amazing! What an amazing and pretty song!”<br>
I was so impressed to the point where my vocabulary had been thrown out the window.<br>
The girl shuddered in shock and looked at my way.<br>
“Eh-... W-who’s there?”<br>
“I am Kaf. I like songsー Err, what else...? Self introductions are kinda hard.”<br>
“Ah! You’re the girl that the Restoration Department spoke of!”<br>
She said as she ran up to me with a smile on her face.<br>
“I’m Rime. Tanioki Rime (谷置狸眼). I’m the same as you, who got called and summoned here from the real world by the Restoration Department.”</p><div>

        As if someone was calling out to me,<br>
        I opened my eyes.<br>

        What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.<br>
        Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.<br>
        <br>
        During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.<br>
        I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,<br>
        It felt like I was losing something important......<br>
        <br>
        With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.<br>
        The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.<br>
        <br>
        A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.<br>
        Though the buildings were sooty,<br>
        and some collapsed here and there.<br>
        The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,<br>
        and an enormous blue bird was flying around.<br>
        <br>
        A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world<br>
        ------ “Kamitsubaki City”<br>
        That’s where I currently reside.<br>
