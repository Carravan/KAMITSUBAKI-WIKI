			<p>Someone’s singing!<br>
      The moment I realised that, I continued on my tracks.<br>
      That’s right, the Restoration Department talked about this too, that the new residents were girls who love singing. <br>
      They possess the same power as I do, singers whose voices can reach the real world.<br>
      I’m sure I’ll be able to meet this girl if I pursue her singing.<br>
      As if it was an invitation, I kept going.<br>
      Eventually, I arrived at a spacious square. There was a figure of a blue haired girl singing by herself.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      “......!”<br>
      I stood in place, charmed by her song.<br>
      Oblivious of my presence, she immersed herself in singing. A sweet and powerful deep voice.<br>
      Soon after she finished her song, I applauded without much thought.<br>
      “A-amazing! What an amazing and pretty song!”<br>
      I was so impressed to the point where my vocabulary had been thrown out the window.<br>
      The girl shuddered in shock and looked at my way.<br>
      “Eh-... W-who’s there?”<br>
      “I am Kaf. I like songsー Err, what else...? Self introductions are kinda hard.”<br>
      “Ah! You’re the girl that the Restoration Department spoke of!”<br>
      She said as she ran up to me with a smile on her face.<br>
      “I’m Rime. Tanioki Rime (谷置狸眼). <br>
      I’m the same as you, who got called and summoned here from the real world by the Restoration Department.”</p>
