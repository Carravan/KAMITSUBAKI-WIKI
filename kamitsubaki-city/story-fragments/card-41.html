      <p>We were hurrying toward the building in the zeroth district when a strange phenomenon occurred.
        "That's.....!"
        The sky had been clear as day just a moment ago, but was now rapidly turning black. It was the same phenomenon we had seen previously, but something was different this time. Countless shapes gushed out of the darkness like water from a fountain. The shapes didn't just look like fish. The unending torrent figures poured from the sky and onto the ground and the building, where the fish started to swim. 
        "Tesseract!?" I blurted out its name without even thinking. 
        "Tesseract? Do you know what this is, Kaf?"
        "The Restoration Department told me about this before. A strange fish-like figure. That's what they called it..."
        I remember what they told me very well. If we just leave the Qs to fester, Tesseract will amass more and more power, until eventually even the real world will get caught in the ensuing corrosion. But in what state would the virtual world be at that point? The Restoration Department never mentioned whether the virtual world would be fine.
        I had the creeping suspicion that something dreadful was unfolding in front of our eyes. 
        Koko's eyes were fixed on the road ahead. "Let's hurry, everyone. Let's head to the Restoration Department and figure out what's going on." I've never seen Koko this tense before.</p>
