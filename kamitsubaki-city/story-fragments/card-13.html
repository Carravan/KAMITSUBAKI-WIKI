<p><em>Translation by Vaynonym</em></p><div>
</div><p>We were walking around the chaotic second district. With the district as loud as it is, I doubt it'll be possibly to follow her singing like how I found Rime. That's why I jumped over my shadow and decided to ask a person on the street.<br>
"I'm sorry, do you happen to know of a girl that likes songs in the vicinity?"<br>
As I did, an elderly lady turned around, and answered bluntly.<br>
"A girl that likes songs? There're a dime in a dozen, my dear, a dime in a dozen."<br>
Seeing her face distort in annoyance, I felt despondent. In my place, Rime continued.<br>
"Unfortunately, our information is somewhat limited, but we know she's about our age. And she doesn't just listen to songs, she sings herself."<br>
"A girl that sings... now that you mention it, back at the intersection over there, there was a young street musician over there. I think she was singing... rap, they call it, don't they? Maybe that's your girl."<br>
We turned our faces to each other and smiled. That's gotta be a huge lead.<br>
"Thank you very much, lady!"<br>
Rime and I bowed our heads. "Glad to help," the lady smiled. She might've been blunt, but she seemed like a good person at heart.<br>
We parted ways with the older lady and headed toward the intersection she told us about. As we set foot into the crowd, we heard someone singing.</p><div>
