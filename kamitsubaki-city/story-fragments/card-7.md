*Translation by Vaynonym*

The Zeroth District I live in is at the heart of the city. The location I'm looking for, the first district, is on the south-eastern side. I had been walking pretty long by the time I got there. But the view I saw in turn was quite something. Entirely unlike my own district.
"What a beautiful city..."
Arrays of neatly ordered, almost futuristic-looking buildings line the streets. It looks more modern than the real world, in a way.
But for all the buildings, there was no sight of any human beings. I felt a bit scared, alone in a grand district, devoid of other people.
But somewhere here, a new person has arrived. I came here to find that person.
And after investigating like that for 2 hours... I've come to realize how na√Øve my plan was.
The first district is enormous, the buildings are countless. And inside any one, they might be the person I'm looking for. I'm not getting anywhere searching them one by one.
"And what information I got from the Restoration Department is fairly unreliable..."
The only part that I can decipher from it is that it's inside the first district. The rest is too garbled up.
But as I kept searching in spite of it all, suddenly something strange appeared before me.
