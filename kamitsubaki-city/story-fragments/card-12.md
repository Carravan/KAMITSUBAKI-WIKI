*Translation by Saeka*

Rime and I arrive at the Second District. By the time we reached here, the sun had already set. The city submerged in twilight.
It was a red-light district lit with colourful neon lights. The streets were dazzling, and the atmosphere was pretty lively. This area was different from the First District, many people were coming and going.
“There’s this many people…?! I wonder if they’re people who came from the real world.”
“Seems so. But everyone’s so bounderish.”
I agreed with Rime. It looked like there were many delinquents in the Second District. I wonder if these kinds of people sprawl out amidst the crowd.
Even when I was in the real world, I never came to this kind of city.
This is scary, what if we accidentally get involved with them…
Rime held onto my trembling hand.
“It’s gonna be fine Kaf, I’m here with you.”
She looked so gallant and reliable as she said that.
I squeezed back on her hand, and we continued our steps in the Second District.
