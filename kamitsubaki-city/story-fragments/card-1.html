<p><em>Translation by Saeka</em></p><div>
</div><p>As if someone was calling out to me,<br>
I opened my eyes.</p><div>
</div><p>What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.<br>
Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.</p><div>
</div><p>During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.<br>
I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,<br>
It felt like I was losing something important......</p><div>
</div><p>With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.<br>
The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.</p><div>
</div><p>A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.<br>
Though the buildings were sooty,<br>
and some collapsed here and there.<br>
The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,<br>
and an enormous blue bird was flying around.</p><div>
</div><p>A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world<br>
------ “Kamitsubaki City”<br>
That’s where I currently reside.</p><div>
