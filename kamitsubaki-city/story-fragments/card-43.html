      <p>"Central information collection device...? So you've never even been human?!"
        Its tone was clear and factual, the bird named Restoration Department. "I was created for the purpose of averting Kamitsubaki City's destruction as a kind of biological computer. As per the duty bestowed upon me, I have been advancing the plan for the city's restoration."
        Created by whom, exactly? But there were more important questions right now. Koko opened her mouth first, though. "So this thing that's happening right now? Are we in the destruction of Kamitsubaki City?!"
        "It is precisely as you say. With the manifestation of the multi-dimensional life-form Tesseract, the entire city's destruction is imminent. The reason I summoned you here was to prevent this from happening."
        "Why did you have to get Kaf and the others involved..."
        "This entire city is composed of the feelings of human beings. Likewise, the only force that can stand up to to Tesseract is the power of feelings. By gathering a large quantity of virtuous feelings, a "magic" that can repel this despair may be born. In order to save these two worlds, I had no choice but to bet on this course of action."
        "Bet!? Are the lives of all these kids just chips to you? It's not the first time this city has been destroyed anyway, right? Why did you keep silent on this for so long?!"
        "I sincerely apologize for the late explanation...! I've tried to transmit it again and again, but was unable to do."
        The Restoration Department's voice was thick with regret. I couldn't really tell from its face, but I felt like its apology was sincere. 
        "...I had intended to disclose all information when all five of you had assembled. However, Tesseract realized my intentions, and attacked the communication infrastructure, thereby preventing the information from reaching you."
        "So this was the cause of the garbled text, then? So then, the last time the sky was turning black, you crashed into the ground?"
        "When I was on my way to inform you directly, I was subject to Tesseract's attack. Afterward, I took shelter in this building as I attempted to repair the damage. Unfortunately, it appears the time it took to sufficiently repair myself was far too long."
        My heart sank into my stomach. I was only half-way listening through its answers when the questions piled up more and more.
        "... so what's going to happen to this city now?"
        "As in previous iterations, this city will be destroyed. And every inhabitant of this city, myself included, will be annihilated."</p>
