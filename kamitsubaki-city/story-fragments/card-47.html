      <p>Asanushi Haru was running when she began to think. Rime told us to head somewhere safe, but... does such a place even exist? Will we be fine when we get out of the city? Nah, I don't think so. These shadows would chase them to end of the world and back. And if they were safe just by leaving the city, then the Restoration Department would've told them so. Instead, it had tried to save them by returning them to the real world. If that didn't scream "this whole world is doomed" then Haru didn't know what would. 
          "We're really in for it now, aren't we?" Haru thought. "But if we can't run, then..."
          Finally, the fear gave way to something else, a will unquenchable and resolute. She came to a halt and stared down the Tesseracts. Her eyes were incandescent. 
          "What are you doing, Haru? We need to run!"
          "Nah, I'm afraid running just ain't my style. Doesn't seem like there's anywhere to go anyway."
          Rime was shouting. "Then what else are we supposed to do?"
          Haru smiled. "If we can't run, then we just gotta face them head-on. Resolute, until we draw our final breath."
Everyone's eyes widened as Haru's word washed over them.</p>
