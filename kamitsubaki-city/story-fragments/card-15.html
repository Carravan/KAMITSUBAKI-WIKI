        From there, we told Haru our story. How we were summoned from the real world. <br>
        How when we learned that there were others like us, we went looking for them. <br>
        Haru seemed astonished.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just like me, huh. I just came to this world a while back, too."<br>
        "We had the same reaction. It was all so surprising."<br>
        Haru couldn't contain her laughter.<br>
        "I mean, of course I was pretty surprised, but you gotta go with the flow, right? <br>
        And the Restoration Department said that if we don't sing, the real wor<br>ld might be in trouble too. <br>
        So there really wasn't much of a choice other than to just... sing."<br>
        There was no fear or hesitation in her face.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Rime was relieved. <br>
        "So you like singing, too... Since we have the same interests, if you wouldn't mind, I think we should become friends!"<br>
        "Aren't we already? Sounds lovely to me. I was just about tired of singing by myself."<br>
        Our faces lit up at her words. "I'm so excited! Happy to have you with us."<br>
        "Oh the pleasure is all mine! By the way, are there any others? You know, people that got summoned here."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I nodded and pulled out my smartphone. I took a look at the information I had.<br>
        "It seems like there's one more person... in the third district. That's all four of us. Let's put our all into finding them!"<br>
        "Sure, but you wanna start right now? It's getting pretty late, and tomorrow's also a day."<br>
        "Aww, even though we already came all this way out here."<br>
        Rime responded to my obstinance with a forced smile. "Wait up, Kaf. Haru has a point. Let's come back tomorrow in full force, alright?"<br>
        With both of the older girls saying so, I reluctantly backed off. <br>
        And with that, we made the promise to search the third district tomorrow and went our separate ways.
