        One of these days, in the music room as usual, I looked at the vast cityscape from the window, and started to speak.<br>
        "Hey guys, hasn't the city restoration come pretty far now?"<br>
        Rime smiled. <br>
        "That's right. At this rate, looks like the day when we all get to go home might be rather soon."<br>
        Sekai and Koko nodded in agreement. They looked glad. <br>
        In the first place, there's little for me to look forward to in the real world, so I'm starting to think I'd rather spend my time here with the people I met and grew fond of. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's when Haru folded her arms and said, <br>
        "That's all well and good, but before going back to the real world there's something I want to figure out."<br>
        "Something you want to figure out?"<br>
        "You know how there are a lot of these things called Q in the city? All the people that came to the city are working hard to solve them... <br>
        But underneath, there's a way bigger mystery brooding."<br>
        "A bigger mystery...?"<br>
        "The mystery of how this city came to be in the first place. Just who built this city?"<br>
