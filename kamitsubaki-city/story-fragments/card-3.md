*Translation by Vaynonym*

I didn't think something like that could really happen. Not in the real world. Still at a loss, the Restoration Department explained to me what was going on.

Kamitsubaki city is a, well, city that exists inside the virtual world. Its existence is sustained by the power of imagination of the people living in the real world. But that mechanism also comes at a cost, and right now this city is on the verge of destruction...

The reason being that this connection doesn't just deliver the laudable parts. Our malice flows into this world just as much. And in the process, gradually eats away at its fabric.

This is the origin of the  "Q" phenomenonâ€”
by solving the countless "Q"s plaguing Kamitsubaki city, this malice is gradually purified and the city can be restored.

For that purpose, the Restoration Department gathers people from the real world willing to help in the restoration. I was the first.

"Dear Kaf,
You possess a power that no one else possesses. The mysterious power inside your songs seeps even into the real world.
We request to harness your singing in order to rally everyone to come here - those who, by solving the Qs, will revive this city."

I still didn't quite know what was what, but receiving a request like that, I decided to take on that role anyway.
I don't have any parents. I have no one who'd even notice my absence in the real world.

So then why wouldn't I go here instead? If I can save this city by singing, then I'll gladly sing for it!
