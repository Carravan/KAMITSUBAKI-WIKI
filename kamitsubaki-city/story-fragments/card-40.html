      <p>"A message!?"
          I took out my smartphone and, lo and behold, it's a message from the restoration department.

          --------------------
          Title: Emergency
          Main Body:
          I request all of you to come to my current location.
          My whereabouts are the zeroth district 1-7-3.
          I'm in the basement of the abandoned building. 
          --------------------

          Judging by how short the message was for the department, it seemed quite urgent.
          Haru's bitterness extended from her voice to her face. "Seems suspicious if you ask me. Not a single message all this time, and now all of a sudden with this timing?"
          I felt the same way, but Sekai shook her head. "It does seem questionable... but this is the first time the Restoration Department shared its location with us. Things are different this time."
          "And what if the location's a lie?" 
          "Then we'll end the day with a few more steps to our name. Either way, there's no harm in trying."
          It was rare for Sekai to be so adamant and speak so strongly about something. We nodded to each other and started toward the location.</p>
