*Translation by Vaynonym*

â€”How much time has passed since that day, I wonder. I've been singing in Kamitsubaki City ever since.

Following the promise I made with the Restoration Department, I can't return to the original world until the restoration of the city is complete. In exchange, I'm provided everything I need to live by the Restoration Department.

Thanks to that, I could focus solely on singing. Like any other day, I singing vibrantly starting early in the morning. Remembering how I lived before this, I break out into laughter.

(At first, I had my doubts whether I could actually reach people from the real word just by singing........)

The restoration department seemed rather dubious to me anyway. I didn't mind putting my all into restoring the city. That wasn't the issue. I just had a feeling they were deceiving me somehow.

Even so, I kept singing, and after some time, little by little more people appeared in the city. It really did happen, what the restoration department told me.

Even right now, I can see the people that came to this world walking around and solving the Qs. This ghost town of a city has actually become fairly busy.

"But man, I can't help but feel a little lonely. I wish there were others like me, singing."

I'm the only person that even goes to this school. I have no one to call my friends. Singing alone like this, day in day out, I guess it's only natural I feel a sense of solitude.
