			<p>The girl who introduced herself as Rime, told me that clearly.<br>
      Sure enough there’s no doubt about it, she’s a witch that the Restoration Department had mentioned. <br>
      I sighed in relief, and Rime continued.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      “I’m glad to have met you, Kaf. <br>
      I had heard about the other girl that was summoned too, but everything other than her name is too garbled up to be read."<br>
      “I could only read a part of the address here. <br>
      The messages that the Restoration Department sends are always so half-assed and annoying.”<br>
      We laughed together. Even though we had just met, it felt like we were friends from long ago. <br>
      There was a strange affinity between us.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      “By the way Rime, when the Restoration Department had called you, <br>
      did they also say that we can’t go back until all the Qs in this city are solved?”<br>
      “Seems like it. When I first heard about it I thought it was some kind of joke, <br>
      but about a week has already passed since then… I guess it’s true.”<br>
      “You’ve already been here since a week ago?! The Restoration Department should’ve told me sooner.”<br>
      They had been hiding about it for whatever reason, maybe they simply forgot about it. <br>
      As usual, I couldn’t really understand what the Restoration Department was thinking.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      But right now, it was more important that I finally had a friend.<br>
      “...When I came to this city, I had always been alone. That’s why I’m really glad that you came here, Rime.”<br>
      It didn't matter that we were put under the same circumstances. I was overjoyed that I finally had a friend to sing with in this city. <br>
        I’m sure that Rime also felt the same way.<br>
      I said with a gentle smile on my face.<br>
      “Yeah, I was also lonely actually… But from now on I’m not alone anymore.”<br>
      Rime held out her hand to me.<br>
      “Let’s do our best from now on, Kaf. Solving the Qs in this city, until the day we can return to the real world!ー”<br>
      “Yeah, let’s sing together, and reach the people in the real world from this virtual world!”<br>
      In the dusky street corner, I took her hand. I could feel the warmth and reassurance from our joined hands.</p>
