</div><p>The girl who introduced herself as Rime, told me that clearly.<br>
Sure enough there’s no doubt about it, she’s a witch that the Restoration Department had mentioned. I sighed in relief, and Rime continued.<br>
“I’m glad to have met you, Kaf. I had heard about the other girl that was summoned too, but everything other than her name is too garbled up to be read."<br>
“I could only read a part of the address here. The messages that the Restoration Department sends are always so half-assed and annoying.”<br>
We laughed together. Even though we had just met, it felt like we were friends from long ago. There was a strange affinity between us.<br>
“By the way Rime, when the Restoration Department had called you, did they also say that we can’t go back until all the Qs in this city are solved?”<br>
“Seems like it. When I first heard about it I thought it was some kind of joke, but about a week has already passed since then… I guess it’s true.”<br>
“You’ve already been here since a week ago?! The Restoration Department should’ve told me sooner.”<br>
They had been hiding about it for whatever reason, maybe they simply forgot about it. As usual, I couldn’t really understand what the Restoration Department was thinking.<br>
But right now, it was more important that I finally had a friend.<br>
“...When I came to this city, I had always been alone. That’s why I’m really glad that you came here, Rime.”<br>
It didn't matter that we were put under the same circumstances. I was overjoyed that I finally had a friend to sing with in this city. I’m sure that Rime also felt the same way.<br>
I said with a gentle smile on my face.<br>
“Yeah, I was also lonely actually… But from now on I’m not alone anymore.”<br>
Rime held out her hand to me.<br>
“Let’s do our best from now on, Kaf. Solving the Qs in this city, until the day we can return to the real world!ー”<br>
“Yeah, let’s sing together, and reach the people in the real world from this virtual world!”<br>
In the dusky street corner, I took her hand. I could feel the warmth and reassurance from our joined hands.</p><div>

        As if someone was calling out to me,<br>
        I opened my eyes.<br>

        What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.<br>
        Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.<br>
        <br>
        During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.<br>
        I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,<br>
        It felt like I was losing something important......<br>
        <br>
        With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.<br>
        The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.<br>
        <br>
        A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.<br>
        Though the buildings were sooty,<br>
        and some collapsed here and there.<br>
        The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,<br>
        and an enormous blue bird was flying around.<br>
        <br>
        A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world<br>
        ------ “Kamitsubaki City”<br>
        That’s where I currently reside.<br>
