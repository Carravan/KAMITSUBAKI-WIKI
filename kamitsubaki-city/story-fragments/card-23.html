        Now that they mentioned it, it was true. The city itself was clad in mystery.<br>
        When I was summoned here, there wasn't a single person around. <br>
        Which begs the question, who created this city? Where did they go?<br>
        It seems like everyone was drawn in by the mystery. Sekai's head tilted slightly to the side. <br>
        "Now that I think about it, even this school is strange. With no students there to attend, why is there a fully functional school in this city?"<br>
        "Right? It's so strange. That's why I've been thinking. <br>
        Originally, there must have been a lot of people here... so for what reason did they disappear?<br>
        And finally, why was the city left in tatters. There had to be something there. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Koko seemed to think the same, and finally Haru spoke. 
        "In that case, I'm intrigued by the disappearance of the inhabitants. For what purpose? But how do we even go about finding out such a thing?"<br>
        "Our only avenue's the Restoration Department... I'm sure they're hiding something. <br>
        I mean, the only ever communicate by messages. They have yet to show their face."<br>
        "I agree. There's definitely something off about the Restoration Department. But our only avenue... <br>
        I'm sure there has to be another way."<br>
        "There's another rather simple one. We could just walk around the city and investigate ourselves. <br>
        They might be gone now, but if they lived here once, then there must be some traces left to scour. <br>
        And among them, perhaps a clue to their disappearance. <br>
