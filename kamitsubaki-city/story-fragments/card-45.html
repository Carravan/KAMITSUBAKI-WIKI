      <p>Rinne Koko shuddered at the scene before her eyes. A shadow the shape of a fish appeared out of nowhere, manifested and attacked the Restoration Department... and finally swallowed it whole. 
        "This is bad!"
        The Restoration Department's pained voice rang out from inside the fish's maw. With enormous force the fish shut it's maw. A metallic, rending sound later, the voice had stopped. 
        Silence enveloped the lifeless, sterile room. The pillars of light enveloping the five witches were gone. Their only path back to the real world, cut off. No one made a sound. They all just stood there, silent and unmoving and shuddering at the scene unfolding in front of their eyes. Finally, the blackfish - Tesseract - fixed its gaze upon a new target.
        "W-we have to get out of here, everyone! We're as good as dead if we stay here!"
        Koko grabbed the hands of Kaf and Sekai and began to sprint. Soon after, Rime and Haru came back to their senses and followed after them. While they ran up the stairs, a thought seized Koko's mind and refused to let go. "I have to protect these kids. I'm the oldest one, after all."
        Even before coming to this city, Koko had secretly felt this way. For that sake, Koko was willing to throw away her life in the real world and come to this place. She may not have been good with words, but that was something she could do for her friends. If it came down to it, she would gladly give her life to protect them, a stalwart conviction filling her mind with courage. 
        However, when they arrived above ground, the bizarre scene in front of her immediately smashed any such hope. "W-what is this?"
        The entire area was swarming with manifested shadows. Tesseracts, far too many to conceive, attacked the people of the city.</p>
