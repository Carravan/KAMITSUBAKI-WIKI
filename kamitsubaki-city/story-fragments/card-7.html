</div><p>The Zeroth District I live in is at the heart of the city. The location I'm looking for, the first district, is on the south-eastern side. I had been walking pretty long by the time I got there. But the view I saw in turn was quite something. Entirely unlike my own district.<br>
"What a beautiful city..."<br>
Arrays of neatly ordered, almost futuristic-looking buildings line the streets. It looks more modern than the real world, in a way.<br>
But for all the buildings, there was no sight of any human beings. I felt a bit scared, alone in a grand district, devoid of other people.<br>
But somewhere here, a new person has arrived. I came here to find that person.<br>
And after investigating like that for 2 hours... I've come to realize how naïve my plan was.<br>
The first district is enormous, the buildings are countless. And inside any one, they might be the person I'm looking for. I'm not getting anywhere searching them one by one.<br>
"And what information I got from the Restoration Department is fairly unreliable..."<br>
The only part that I can decipher from it is that it's inside the first district. The rest is too garbled up.<br>
But as I kept searching in spite of it all, suddenly something strange appeared before me.</p><div>

        As if someone was calling out to me,<br>
        I opened my eyes.<br>

        What reflected in my eyes was an empty music room in the early afternoon.<br>
        Seems like I dozed off on my seat from the exhaustion of singing.<br>
        <br>
        During that brief nap, I think I had a dream.<br>
        I couldn’t really remember the fine details but,<br>
        It felt like I was losing something important......<br>
        <br>
        With a faint ache in my chest, I stood up.<br>
        The view outside the window was more unrealistic than a dream.<br>
        <br>
        A miscellaneous cityscape of colourful blocks stacked upon each other.<br>
        Though the buildings were sooty,<br>
        and some collapsed here and there.<br>
        The scarlet sun hung in the white sky,<br>
        and an enormous blue bird was flying around.<br>
        <br>
        A mysterious city that exists in a virtual world<br>
        ------ “Kamitsubaki City”<br>
        That’s where I currently reside.<br>
