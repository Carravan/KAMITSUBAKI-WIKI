      </div><p>The Zeroth District I live in is at the heart of the city. The location I'm looking for, the first district, is on the south-eastern side. <br>
      I had been walking pretty long by the time I got there. But the view I saw in turn was quite something. Entirely unlike my own district.<br>
      "What a beautiful city..."<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      Arrays of neatly ordered, almost futuristic-looking buildings line the streets. <br>
      It looks more modern than the real world, in a way.<br>
      But for all the buildings, there was no sight of any human beings. I felt a bit scared, alone in a grand district, devoid of other people.<br>
      But somewhere here, a new person has arrived. I came here to find that person.<br>
      And after investigating like that for 2 hours... I've come to realize how na√Øve my plan was.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      The first district is enormous, the buildings are countless. And inside any one, they might be the person I'm looking for. <br>
        I'm not getting anywhere searching them one by one.<br>
      "And what information I got from the Restoration Department is fairly unreliable..."<br>
      The only part that I can decipher from it is that it's inside the first district. The rest is too garbled up.<br>
      But as I kept searching in spite of it all, suddenly something strange appeared before me.</p>
