<h1>Origin</h1>
<p><img src="/hat1.png" alt="hat1.png" class="right" style="width: 20%; border: 1px solid #fff;" />The Hat is part of Joucho's VWP costume and was revealed on 13/03/2021 during KAF's Q2 concert, alongside the reveal of VWP itself.
<p>It quickly gained in popularity on the English Kamitsubaki Fan-Discord due to its, frankly, ridicoulous size, adding to Joucho's refinded yet adorable appearance. Joucho is perceived to have talent in many areas, which has since been attributed to The Hat. Some would go as far as to say that Joucho is actually The Hat, and the human called Joucho just happened to put it on. Another theory suggests the character known as "Joucho" is a protrusion generated by The Hat in order to fit into human (witch?) society. According to this theory, the ostensible incidences where Joucho appeared without wearing The Hat are explained by The Hat's immense power, being able to control her body even from afar. In another theory, it is stated that The Hat might have invisibility powers. If so, then the hat could be right behind you, dear reader, right this very moment, and you would be non-the-wiser, unable to even perceive its presense safe for a brief glimpse during your demise, when The Hat is known to soothe its victims by revealing its momentous countenance and ludicrous size. As of the writing of this article, the true origins and extent of The Hat's power is still unknown. Should you encounter The Hat, we advise caution and assuming a stance implying reverence, as the only proven method against The Hat is appealing to its grace.*</p>

* This has been experimentally verified as, so far, no known worshipper of The Hat has been taken by The Hat. This behavior has been woefully misinterpreted by the public as the forming of a cult around The Hat, which is of course preposterous, there is no cult, and any claims to the contrary are going to be met with Certain Vengeance by The Hat, be it through its own power or through a layer of human indirection.
