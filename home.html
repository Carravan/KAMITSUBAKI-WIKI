<p><img class="right" style="top: -8px; width: 10%" src="/loreicon.png" />Welcome to the KAMITSUBAKI LORE Wiki!</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to assemble an English source for Vsingers and related content, created by KAMITSUBAKI STUDIO.</p>
<p>This Wiki is a fan project of the <a href="https://discord.gg/NwCy89U"><strong>KAMITSUBAKI STUDIO Unofficial English Community</strong></a> Discord server. We are not affiliated with KAMITSUBAKI STUDIO.</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>If you don't see any pages on the Navigation Section to the left, you may be using Static Navigation instead of Site Tree Navigation.</p>

<p>Click the "Browse" button on the top left, on top of the Navigation Section, to change that so it now says "Main Menu". This will cycle the Navigation Section from using Static Navigation, to using Site Tree Navigation.</p>

<p>Site Tree Navigation is automatically generated. Static Navigation has not been properly organized yet. (todo)</p>
