<h1>Origin</h1>
<p><img src="/hat1.png" alt="hat1.png" class="right" style="width: 20%; border: 1px solid #fff;" />The Hat is part of Joucho's VWP costume and  was revealed on 13/03/2021 during KAF's Q2 concert, alongside the reveal of VWP itself.
<p>It quickly gained in popularity on the Discord due to it's, frankly, ridicoulous size, adding to Joucho's refinded yet adorable appearance. Joucho is perceived to have talent in many areas, which has since been attributed to The Hat. Some would go as far as to say that Joucho is actually The Hat, and the human called Joucho just happened to put it on.</p>
