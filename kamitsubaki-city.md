**Kamitsubaki City Under Construction**, abbreviated as **Kamicity UC**, is a franchise of games (and other projects?) set in the virtual city Kamitsubaki City. 

## Emergence

**Kamitsubaki City Under Construction Emergence**, or simply **Emergence**, is a collaborative puzzle solving experience, or alternate reality game, played on a mobile-only webapp and a discord server. The game started on 2021 Oct 4, ended on Oct 31, and the [webpage](https://uc.kamitsubaki.jp/zero) made inaccessible two months later in 2021 Dec.

Players can register and login with a twitter or a line account. When a puzzle is released at the announced time, each player will recieve a clue, which may be different between players needed to be pieced together. Players then have to work through an unspeicfied numbers of puzzles or redirections, such as deciphering codes, interacting with discord bot, or playing minigames. A puzzle is solved when players collectively reach the target score, by submitting textual answers or phone's GPS locations, which will unlock the next part of the story, an artwork, and a clip of music.

## Others

Three new projects were announced after Emergence concluded:

- Chronicle, a light novel
- Narrative, a tabletop RPG, and
- Regenerative, a visual novel (?)
