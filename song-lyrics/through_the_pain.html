</p>
<p>
  Little by little I‘m starting to forget
  <br>
  how to believe in myself.
  <br>
  Maybe it‘s too late now to find my true self.
  <br>
  Dear writer of this tale,
  <br>
  I ask you, show me the secret to this world
  <br>
  Show me, show me, show me - my true self

</p>
<p>
  Through the pain, the grief, the suffering
  <br>
  we soar, we live on!
  <br>
  Without knowing why,
  <br>
  We‘re searching for an answer.
</p>
  
<p>
  We who search for the meaning of life.
  <br>
  We who seek some grand meaning.
  <br>
  We still haven‘t figured out
  <br>
  why we are so deeply flawed.
  <br>
  But that‘s okay.
</p>
<p>
  I‘m terrified of becoming someone
  <br>
  who never takes any chances.
  <br>
  Can we really get back the cityscape like this?
  <br>
  The song that crossed my mind that fated day,
  <br>
  no matter what I tried, I just couldn‘t remember it
</p>
<p>
  The ideals I wish for are silly.
  <br>
  But even so, even so, even so,
  <br>
  it‘s a world I want to see.
  <br>
  We will not cast aside
  <br>
  the overflowing, the crumbling, the breaking.
</p>
<p>
  Farewell, you splendidly fading evening view.
  <br>
  We can never allow this tragedy to repeat.
  <br>
  There‘s an indelible mass of possibilities.
  <br>
  And even now, we won‘t give up.
	<br>
  We don‘t need words to describe it
</p>
<p>
  Before we drown in the twilight, 
  <br>
  let‘s just tear everything down ourselves.
  <br>
  With these scarred hearts, 
  <br>
  battered by our endless journey, 
  <br>
  through the pain, the grief, the suffering -
  <br>
  we will soar, we will scream!
</p>
<p> 
  We who search for the meaning of life.
  <br>
  We who seek some grand meaning.
  <br>
  We might not have figured out
  <br>
  why we are so deeply flawed. 
  <br>
  But even so, we have our songs.
  <br>
  For us, the love still remains.
  <br>
  We sing because we‘re looking for an answer.
  <br>
  And even now, we won‘t give up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isn’t that right? Isn‘t that right? Isn‘t that right?
</p>
