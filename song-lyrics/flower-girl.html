<hr>

<p>
    To my past self,<br>
    you‘ve been both an ally and an enemy,<br>
    but for some reason, I felt like you always hated me.<br>
    It‘s not my intention to talk down to you, but...<br>
    „It‘s all about the surface and appearance, I don‘t care about anything else“<br>
    isn‘t that way of thinking a little off?<br>
    I want to set your mind at ease.
</p>

<p>
    At first, I saw you as an enemy.<br>
    Always with that insincere smile on my face,<br>
    showing that, really, I just didn‘t know what to do with myself<br>
    I doubted myself just going through my daily life <br>
    That day, I bought a flower in front of the station<br>
    I gave you one because I thought it looked good on you, somehow<br>
    You preserved the flower and put it in your bookshelf<br>
    „Something like that has no value, right?“<br>
    you said, as you did so
</p>

<p>
    „Just knowing that I was loved,<br>
    that‘s enough for me.<br>
    I still don‘t have all the answers,<br>
    so tell me when I‘m on the wrong track!<br>
    Well, for now, let me just say – <br>
    I love you“
</p>

<p>
    I can do nothing better than sigh<br>
    Even when something was up, I just gave you a flower<br>
    that expressed my feelings<br>
    Every flower was preserved, and decorated the interior<br>
    And so, your house had become cluttered with flowers, scattered everywhere
</p>

<p>
    „Well then, shall we place them in my room?“<br>
    (Huh, what the hell are you saying?<br>
    Haven‘t we been enemies until now? Hey!<br>
    Despite falling for that guy?)
</p>

<p>
    „Yeah, that‘s right. I fell in love with him.“<br>
    (Hey, did you forget?<br>
    You‘ve really forgotten about everything?<br>
    It‘s in our nature to look down on others)<br>
    This guy is different<br>
    (What the hell is different about him?<br>
    If you can believe someone that easily, then go do it alone<br>
    Right, you flower girl!?)
</p>

<p>
    Changing myself, I just couldn‘t do it<br>
    I always get so shy when I‘m with you<br>
    Pretending to think nothing‘s wrong<br>
    Brilliantly, without knowing the meaning of love
</p>

<p>
    As I didn‘t have any confidence<br>
    The days like that just piled up<br>
    Even the petals of the flower I gave you that day,<br>
    lost its color after all this time
</p>

<p>
    Ah, that‘s right. There‘s no such thing as something eternal.<br>
    No matter how much you try to preserve a flower, it‘ll wither in the end<br>
    We, too, will grow old and come to an end<br>
    The daily life unfolding, the happy memories, everything is all just going to disappear one day<br>
    If everything is just going to wither, crumple and fall, then what am I supposed to do?
</p>

<p>
    It was too soon for thoughts like that<br>
    Because with pain comes wisdom<br>
    I don‘t care about time anymore
</p>

<p>
    Yeah!
</p>

<p>
    I‘m sorry about our parting<br>
    You only get one life
</p>

<p>
    Our mutual sighs connect us<br>
    It‘s always about flowers for me<br>
    Goodbye, goodbye<br>
    to the me up to now
</p>

<p>
    If you can say you love someone<br>
    that alone is enough<br>
    We‘ll continue to get hurt from now on<br>
    and if I‘m on the wrong path, I want you to tell me<br>
    I swear upon this flower<br>
    I love you
</p>

<p>
    (To my future self,<br>
    looks like you‘ve become just another adult<br>
    you really have become just another adult, haven‘t you?<br>
    Worthless… absolutely worthless<br>
    All the pain from your past isn‘t just going to disappear<br>
    There‘s no way I‘ll stop being your enemy<br>
    Holding onto your pain and going on,<br>
    and finally letting it scatter brilliantly – wouldn‘t that be nice)
</p>

<p>
    (just like the flowers that fell to the ground, swaying and overflowing)
</p>

<p>
    I don‘t care about customs
</p>

<p>
    I‘m over appearances by now<br>
    Coming to you with just a bouquet of flowers,<br>
    that‘s how it should be.
</p>
