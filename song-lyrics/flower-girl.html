<h1>Lyrics</h1>

<p>Translation by Vaynonym</p>

<hr>

<p>To my past self,</p>
<p>you‘ve been both an ally and an enemy,</p>
<p>but for some reason, I felt like you always hated me.</p>
<p>It‘s not my intention to talk down to you, but...</p>
<p>„It‘s all about the surface and appearance, I don‘t care about anything else“</p>
<p>isn‘t that way of thinking a little off?</p>
<p>I want to set your mind at ease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At first, I saw you as an enemy.</p>
<p>Always with that insincere smile on my face,</p>
<p>showing that, really, I just didn‘t know what to do with myself</p>
<p>I doubted myself just going through my daily life </p>
<p>That day, I bought a flower in front of the station</p>
<p>I gave you one because I thought it looked good on you, somehow</p>
<p>You preserved the flower and put it in your bookshelf</p>
<p>„Something like that has no value, right?“</p>
<p>you said, as you did so</p>
<p> </p>
<p>„Just knowing that I was loved,</p>
<p>that‘s enough for me.</p>
<p>I still don‘t have all the answers,</p>
<p>so tell me when I‘m on the wrong track!</p>
<p>Well, for now, let me just say – </p>
<p>I love you“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can do nothing better than sigh</p>
<p>Even when something was up, I just gave you a flower</p>
<p>that expressed my feelings</p>
<p>Every flower was preserved, and decorated the interior</p>
<p>And so, your house had become cluttered with flowers, scattered everywhere</p>
<p> </p>
<p>„Well then, shall we place them in my room?“</p>
<p>(Huh, what the hell are you saying?</p>
<p>Haven‘t we been enemies until now? Hey!</p>
<p>Despite falling for that guy?)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>„Yeah, that‘s right. I fell in love with him.“</p>
<p>(Hey, did you forget?</p>
<p>You‘ve really forgotten about everything?</p>
<p>It‘s in our nature to look down on others)</p>
<p>This guy is different</p>
<p>(What the hell is different about him?</p>
<p>If you can believe someone that easily, then go do it alone</p>
<p>Right, you flower girl!?)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Changing myself, I just couldn‘t do it</p>
<p>I always get so shy when I‘m with you</p>
<p>Pretending to think nothing‘s wrong</p>
<p>Brilliantly, without knowing the meaning of love</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I didn‘t have any confidence</p>
<p>The days like that just piled up</p>
<p>Even the petals of the flower I gave you that day,</p>
<p>lost its color after all this time</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ah, that‘s right. There‘s no such thing as something eternal.</p>
<p>No matter how much you try to preserve a flower, it‘ll wither in the end</p>
<p>We, too, will grow old and come to an end</p>
<p>The daily life unfolding, the happy memories, everything is all just going to disappear one day</p>
<p>If everything is just going to wither, crumple and fall, then what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was too soon for thoughts like that</p>
<p>Because with pain comes wisdom</p>
<p>I don‘t care about time anymore</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I‘m sorry about our parting</p>
<p>You only get one life</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our mutual sighs connect us</p>
<p>It‘s always about flowers for me</p>
<p>Goodbye, goodbye</p>
<p>to the me up to now</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can say you love someone</p>
<p>that alone is enough</p>
<p>We‘ll continue to get hurt from now on</p>
<p>and if I‘m on the wrong path, I want you to tell me</p>
<p>I swear upon this flower</p>
<p>I love you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(To my future self,</p>
<p>looks like you‘ve become just another adult</p>
<p>you really have become just another adult, haven‘t you?</p>
<p>Worthless… absolutely worthless</p>
<p>All the pain from your past isn‘t just going to disappear</p>
<p>There‘s no way I‘ll stop being your enemy</p>
<p>Holding onto your pain and going on,</p>
<p>and finally letting it scatter brilliantly – wouldn‘t that be nice)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(just like the flowers that fell to the ground, swaying and overflowing)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don‘t care about customs</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I‘m over appearances by now</p>
<p>Coming to you with just a bouquet of flowers,</p>
<p>that‘s how it should be.
