Flower Girl is track 8 of Kaf's 2nd album Mahou.

# Lyrics

The song is about a girl who fell in love, having a conversation with her past cynical self. A love song about coming terms with your past self: overcoming bitterness and jadedness from past pain while not turning away from it - rather embracing it.

To my past self,  
you‘ve been both an ally and an enemy,  
but for some reason, I felt like you always hated me.  
It‘s not my intention to talk down to you, but...  
„It‘s all about the surface and appearance, I don‘t care about anything else“  
isn‘t that way of thinking a little off?  
I want to set your mind at ease.

At first, I saw you as an enemy.  
Always with that insincere smile on my face,  
showing that, really, I just didn‘t know what to do with myself  
I doubted myself just going through my daily life  
That day, I bought a flower in front of the station  
I gave you one because I thought it looked good on you, somehow  
You preserved the flower and put it in your bookshelf  
„Something like that has no value, right?“  
you said, as you did so

„Just knowing that I was loved,  
that‘s enough for me.  
I still don‘t have all the answers,  
so tell me when I‘m on the wrong track!  
Well, for now, let me just say –  
I love you“

I can do nothing better than sigh  
Even when something was up, I just gave you a flower  
that expressed my feelings  
Every flower was preserved, and decorated the interior  
And so, your house had become cluttered with flowers, scattered everywhere

„Well then, shall we place them in my room?“  
(Huh, what the hell are you saying?  
Haven‘t we been enemies until now? Hey!  
Despite falling for that guy?)

„Yeah, that‘s right. I fell in love with him.“  
(Hey, did you forget?  
You‘ve really forgotten about everything?  
It‘s in our nature to look down on others)  
This guy is different  
(What the hell is different about him?  
If you can believe someone that easily, then go do it alone  
Right, you flower girl!?)

Changing myself, I just couldn‘t do it  
I always get so shy when I‘m with you  
Pretending to think nothing‘s wrong  
Brilliantly, without knowing the meaning of love

As I didn‘t have any confidence  
The days like that just piled up  
Even the petals of the flower I gave you that day,  
lost its color after all this time

Ah, that‘s right. There‘s no such thing as something eternal.  
No matter how much you try to preserve a flower, it‘ll wither in the end  
We, too, will grow old and come to an end  
The daily life unfolding, the happy memories, everything is all just going to disappear one day  
If everything is just going to wither, crumple and fall, then what am I supposed to do?

It was too soon for thoughts like that  
Because with pain comes wisdom  
I don‘t care about time anymore

Yeah!

I‘m sorry about our parting  
You only get one life

Our mutual sighs connect us  
It‘s always about flowers for me  
Goodbye, goodbye  
to the me up to now

If you can say you love someone  
that alone is enough  
We‘ll continue to get hurt from now on  
and if I‘m on the wrong path, I want you to tell me  
I swear upon this flower  
I love you

(To my future self,  
looks like you‘ve become just another adult  
you really have become just another adult, haven‘t you?  
Worthless… absolutely worthless  
All the pain from your past isn‘t just going to disappear  
There‘s no way I‘ll stop being your enemy  
Holding onto your pain and going on,  
and finally letting it scatter brilliantly – wouldn‘t that be nice)

(just like the flowers that fell to the ground, swaying and overflowing)

I don‘t care about customs

I‘m over appearances by now  
Coming to you with just a bouquet of flowers,  
that‘s how it should be.
